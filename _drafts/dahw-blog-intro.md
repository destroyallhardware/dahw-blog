We live in the age of electronics.  The Internet of Things promises to place instrumentation in every aspect of our lives, so that computers and robots can understand and "think" about the world around us.  Frequently, this puts hardware in situations and places that people dare not tread.

What does it take to create electronics designs that can survive anywhere?

In the age of Make, reliability is oftentimes an afterthought.  Designs are optimized for speed of execution and cost, and are often undertested (except for the most basic functional tests).  Value is placed heavily on using the cutting edge commercial-off-the-shelf components and technologies.

This shift takes advantage of great leaps and bounds in electronics components production, driven in large part by the consumer cell phone and tablet industries, that has brought new components optimized for performance of parameters such as data rates, power consumption, thermal profile, physical form factor, etc.
